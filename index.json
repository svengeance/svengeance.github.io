It doesn’t have the ability to preview Hugo’s shortcodes, so you’ll still need to refresh there, but it’s good for catching basic markdown syntax errors. Markdown Preview to the Right\"\rMarkdown Preview to the Right\r Paste Image: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image My personal favorite - Paste Image allows you to paste an image, straight from your clipboard, into VS Code.

I typically use the markdown preview as I write, and only check Hugo on my browser when verifying I’ve correctly used the shortcodes (Youtube/Discord otherwise). If I’ve done something new or different that I want to verify before pushing live, I will build the site and copy the files manually to observe any differences. Short of anything new, I’ll simply run the build \u0026 deploy script. Have any better ideas? Let me know in the comments – always looking to improve.

Hello! Sven here. Welcome to the first post in my own corner of the internet. Presently I am a C#-focused developer who dabbles in the other realms as necessary.

As a member of a development team I have two objectives that keeps me at the top of my game Be aware of the latest technologies that the world has to offer in the event that I can lead initiatives using these tools to deliver better products to our customers, and to make our company more attractive to other developers Balance the timely needs of the business with the desire to produce clean, well-architected code that stands the test of time: extensible enough to meet future needs, readable enough to be picked up by anyone, and documented enough to give my team confidence to hop on and contribute ","date":"2020-09-22","objectID":"/hello-world/:0:0","tags":[],"title":"Quick Hello!","uri":"/hello-world/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Why blog?

In my relatively short time as a professional developer, it has been through others’ tech blogs such as this one that I have been able to put together various pieces of knowledge to make complete products.
