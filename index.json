[{"categories":[],"content":"Brief introduction, what is this place, and why Sven? Hello! Sven here. Welcome to the first post in my own corner of the internet. Presently I am a C#-focused developer who dabbles in the other realms as necessary. Based in Columbus Ohio, I studied at OSU from ‘13 to ‘17, and met my S.O. there, who I’ve been with a fair number of years. As a member of a development team I have two objectives that keeps me at the top of my game Be aware of the latest technologies that the world has to offer in the event that I can lead initiatives using these tools to deliver better products to our customers, and to make our company more attractive to other developers Balance the timely needs of the business with the desire to produce clean, well-architected code that stands the test of time: extensible enough to meet future needs, readable enough to be picked up by anyone, and documented enough to give my team confidence to hop on and contribute ","date":"2020-09-22","objectID":"/hello-world/:0:0","tags":[],"title":"Quick Hello!","uri":"/hello-world/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Why blog? My goal with this platform is to document some of the things I do, or have done, in my day-to-day as a developer that may make others’ lives easier. I like to think I’m thorough when approaching development tasks, and this usually allows me to find lazy efficient ways at achieving those tasks. In my relatively short time as a professional developer, it has been through others’ tech blogs such as this one that I have been able to put together various pieces of knowledge to make complete products. My hope is that I can further that trend of giving, to write that article that somebody really needed at that point in time.

My first job at Select Sires was fresh out of uni in the Summer of 2017. For the in-person interview, I sat down and was introduced to the team. One of the other devs interviewing me was also named Steve, and I, for reasons I’m unsure of, took this opportunity to avoid conflict and said I go by Sven as a nickname. Now this isn’t entirely untrue: for my German minor in Uni, I went by Sven for the better part of 4 years in all of my classes. I just didn’t expect to carry it with me.
